This font is freeware. It's essentially free for personal use (i.e.
cool-looking lettering for your web pages, groovin' header for your
term papers). If you use it to decorate your web page, let me know! I
might put a link back to your page to show off your creative use of
the font. If you put it on your band's flyers to advertise your gig,
send me a copy! I'd love to see the font at work.

NOTE TO ONLINE FONT ARCHIVERS:

I wanna know where this font is, so I don't want people downloading
it off your font sites. I'll be mad at you if I find it there. If the
person reading this downloaded it from somewhere other than one of my
own sites, contact me immediately.

NOTE TO CD-ROM FONT WOULD-BE "FONTOGRAPHERS":

Don't. Just don't. You know what I'm talking about.
